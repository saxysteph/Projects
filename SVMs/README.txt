How to Reproduce Results:
Open the folder 'scripts'

For the rest, run the file 'SVM.py' to produce the rest of the coding graphs, results, and .csv files. This takes about 5-10 minutes on my laptop. 
The code includes print statements to show the training/validation accuracies during different hyperparameters. 

THE SEED IS ALREADY SET IN THE CODE.
